                    <p1>I am deeply interested in the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, 
                        biomedical technology, and human health. I am motivated by how computational methods 
                        and intelligent systems can be applied to solve complex real-world problems, 
                        particularly those that improve medical technologies and patient outcomes. 
                        My interests center on using AI-driven approaches to analyze data, 
                        support decision-making, and develop innovative solutions that enhance healthcare 
                        delivery and advance our understanding of human health. <br> <br>
                        In my AI II course, I worked on a semi-automatic breast tumor segmentation system 
                        using a foundation model (SAM) combined with radiologist guidance to improve accuracy 
                        and efficiency in medical imaging analysis. A link to the final project presentation is proivded.
